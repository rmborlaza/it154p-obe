# Attendance Monitoring System
Final Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) Project for Interfacing Machine-to-Machine Communications (IT154P) course.

## Overview
The system uses microcontrollers for capture of NFC-RFID data, a cloud-based RESTful web service, a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) desktop application for Windows 10 and a Xamarin Android mobile application.
The microcontrollers used are Arduino Uno, Arduino Leonardo, and WeMos D1 R2. The hardware also used a Mifare RC-522 RFID module.
The UWP app is used by the systems administrators to view and manage the data in the system. This includes the attendance logs and user account information.
The mobile application is used by the end users to view their attendance.
